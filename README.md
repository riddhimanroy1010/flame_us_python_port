# flame_us_python_port
This code entirely belongs to Alexandre Milovanoff. This is my attempt at porting the code over to python. This is my project as part of ESROP-UofT. I am attempting to bring this R model for predicting GHG emissions of fleets of light vehicles in the US to python and emulate the R environment structure, R functions and the established class structure.
